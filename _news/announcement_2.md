I’m excited to have <a href="https://remark42.com/">Remark42</a> on my website because it keeps the conversation here without the usual “and now 17 trackers would like to meet you” vibe. Comments live entirely in my homelab, so there’s no third party platform, no weird data sharing, and no surprise ad-tech party in the background!

It’s running in Docker and exposed through Nginx Proxy Manager in a segmented DMZ VLAN, with CrowdSec keeping the internet goblins on a short leash! Hopefully soon I'll write about my homelab as well, so keep tuned!
